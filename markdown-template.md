## Post Content

### Text Content

‚òïÔ∏è It's 2 AM. The twitter screenshot open in one tab. 50,000 logs of malicious requests in the other.

How did they get my AI chatbot to generate harmful content? And why did they have to post it on twitter?

You try to open your eyes bigger as if that would somehow make the problem reveal itself. You thought your prompt would prevent this.
Let me show you the better way.

Effective AI Engineering #28: Input Guardrails üëá

The Problem ‚ùå

Many developers send all user inputs directly to expensive LLMs without pre-filtering. This creates challenges that aren't immediately obvious:

[Code example - see attached image]

Why this approach falls short:

- Resource Waste: Malicious queries consume expensive LLM tokens even when they'll be rejected
- Inconsistent User Experience: LLMs might occasionally comply with harmful requests despite instructions
- High Latency: Every query requires full LLM processing before potential rejection

The Solution: Pre-Processing Input Classification ‚úÖ

A better approach is to classify problematic inputs with a lightweight model before they reach your expensive main models. This pattern blocks attacks at minimal cost while providing intelligent threat detection.

[Code example - see attached image]

Why this approach works better:

- Cost Protection: Malicious queries get blocked by a cheap model before hitting expensive ones
- Intelligent Detection: AI classification catches sophisticated attacks that simple rules miss
- Scalable Defense: One lightweight model protects all your expensive downstream models

The Takeaway ‚úàÔ∏è

Input guardrails block problematic queries before they consume expensive resources, providing faster and more reliable protection than LLM-only approaches. This pattern dramatically reduces costs from malicious usage while improving response times.
